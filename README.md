## Hi there 👋

I am:

👷‍♂️ An AI engineer at Showpad
🧪 An experimental psychologist, somehow
🤓 An anime buff, amongst other nerdy things
🧗 A sports enthusiast (but what do you care, this is GitHub)

As far as coding is concerned, I love:

🎨 Clean and well-documented code
🤺 Overengineering projects (even those that attempt to put a halt to overengineering *cough* LangChain *cough*)
🐍 Python (but looking to branch out)

And also:

🚀 Emoji bullet lists that hide my real age
